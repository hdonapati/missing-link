# Automation to **Create an Alarm for Flight Check-in**

## Description:
The Flight Check-in Reminder Shortcut is a handy automation designed to assist users in staying on top of their upcoming flights. Leveraging the power of Shortcuts on iOS, iPadOS, and macOS, this tool scans your calendar for flights scheduled for the next day and creates timely reminders for check-in.

**Features**:
1. Automatic Daily Trigger: The Shortcut is set to run daily, activating after midnight to ensure you receive timely reminders.
2. Calendar Event Retrieval: It fetches upcoming calendar events for the next day, specifically identifying flights based on specified criteria.
3. Check-in Alarm Creation: For each identified flight, the Shortcut calculates the optimal check-in time (24 hours before departure) and creates a reminder or alarm for the current day.

> [!NOTE]  
> **Calendar Integration**: Ensure that your flight information is added to the calendar app associated with your mail app. This typically happens automatically when you receive a flight booking email.

## Setting up Automation:

Open the Shortcuts app and navigate to the "Automation" tab. 
Use the '+' button on top-right  corner to create a new automation.




> [!TIP]
> Customize the Shortcut to your preferences, including notification settings and any additional features you may need. Alternatively you can create areminder instead of an alarm, or do both. Alarm better suited for my purpose.
